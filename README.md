# 🥐 Toastify Android App

**Toastify** is a lightweight Android application built using **Kotlin** and **XML**. It displays a toast message when a user enters their **name** and **city** into the input fields and taps the **Submit** button.

## 📱 Features
- Clean and simple UI using Android XML layouts
- Takes user input for Name and City
- Generates a custom toast message like:  
  `"Hello Akarsh! Greetings from Vadodara! 🎉"`

## 🛠️ Built With

- Kotlin (Android)
